# truss_analysis
Analysis of a space structure (truss) using MATLAB, Finite Elements Mode (FEM) and Spectral Elements Mode.

This project is my subject of research in my undergraduate scientific research at Unesp - SÃ£o Paulo State University, supported by NDE (Nucleus of Dynamics in Engineering) and funded by CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development).

The objectives of this research are the implementation of MATLAB codes to undestand the behavior of a space truss and methods of analysis,  such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method and control of vibration. The model will be developed using unidimensional elements (bars).
